This project provides very easy way to simulating supercontinuum generati or pulse evolution in PCF fibers. It provides many functionalities for representing pulses of lasers, fibers,  and methods for simulating four-wave-mixing processes such as supercontinuum generation. Also, It provides a simple and easy-to-use GUI.

## How to use it
There are two ways to run the project.

1 . Run executable file.
  * Download executable file from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1b4K4iEmiHYbYm4HQAWyA4g)
  * Run `pulse_evolution.exe`

2 . Run Python file.
  * `git clone https://github.com/Walleclipse/Pulse_Evolution.git`
  * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  *  `python main.py`

The GUI is as following:

After setting the parameter of the pulse, fiber and propogation, click the `Run` bottom.  

The sample result is as following  (blue curve represents input pulse, red curve represents output pulse):
